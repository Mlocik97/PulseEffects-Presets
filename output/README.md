Preset was created primarly for Z333 & Z337 and also was tested on Z333, but probably/maybe can be used on any 2.1 speaker. Preset can be customized for Your needs and Your audio system.

Preset is focused primarly for music.

For best experience, I recommend to set subwoofer "volume" at half (50%), on back of Your subwoofer. Like on this image:
![Z333 Z337 Subwoofer Backend](https://www.logitech.com/assets/64689/3/z333-speaker-system-with-subwoofer.jpg)

I also recommend to place subwoofer to corner of room, as at this schema: ![Z333 Z337 Schema](https://i.imgur.com/bbQlSRc.png)
(purple = subwoofer, yellow = repro, orange = You, arrow = direction)

Preset is to increase DR/LR, enchant, and for bass boost (with increasing hardness and capacity of bass), together with autogain it provide nearly "best" You can get from Z333 & Z337.
